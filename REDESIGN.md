# Redesign - A new way to build this application

## What am I building?

A "simple" budget application. It should be the standard, web-based UI + API. Main reason: I'm comfortable building applications this way. Second reason: I would like an easy avenue to experiment with building a mobile app for this later. Even a basic UI wrapper around a web interface is enough justification for a separate API.

At the end of the day, this is a glorified spreadsheet. The same functionality *could* be built in Excel, it would just be a little less accessible.

Yes, largely inspired by EveryDollar.
